#Hello-World

My name is Ghadi Stephan. I am a financial analyst, working in the Banking & Investment Industry with over 6 years of experience in analyzing listed companies and present profitable investment recommendations, using advanced excel and financial modeling to analyze company data.
I recently got introduced to the Data Analysis world (outside of the financial sector) and got amazed by the power of data and the impact it can have on any type of business.
I started learning SQL, and looking forward to learn a coding language (Python) and keep improving my skills to make the most of these amazing tools that enable us to uncover insights from the unstructured world of data.
