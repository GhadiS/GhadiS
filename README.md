#Hello-World

My name is Ghadi Stephan. I am a financial advisor, working in the Banking & Investment Industry with over 6 years of experience in analyzing listed companies and making investment recommendations, using excel and spreadsheets to analyze company data.
I recently got introduced to the Data Analysis world (outside of the financial sector) and got amazed by the power of data and the impact it can have on any type of business.
I started learning SQL, and looking forward to learn a coding language (Python) and keep learning and improving to make the most of these amazing tools that can allow us to do much more with data oustide the capabilities of excel.
